      Browser fingerprinting collects extensive information about your web browser through JavaScript APIs and HTTP headers. This includes details like browser name and version, user agent string, language and locale settings, time zone, screen resolution, installed fonts, and supported MIME types. Even subtle differences in browser configurations—such as enabled cookies, Do Not Track status, or supported HTML5 features—can contribute to creating a unique profile. This fingerprint can be used to identify and track your device across different websites, even without the use of cookies.

    content: >
      Browser fingerprints are often highly unique due to the vast number of possible combinations of browser attributes. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of browsers have unique fingerprints, allowing trackers to identify individual users across different sessions and websites. This tracking persists even when users employ traditional privacy measures like clearing cookies or using private browsing modes.

  - title: Protection Strategies
    icon: mdi:shield-check
    items:
      - Use privacy-focused browsers like [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/), which standardizes browser fingerprints to make all users appear the same, or [Brave](https://brave.com/), which includes built-in fingerprinting protections.
      - Enable strict privacy settings and tracking protection features available in browsers like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), which can block third-party cookies and trackers.
      - Install extensions like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) or [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) to block ads and trackers that may use fingerprinting.
      - Use extensions that specifically target fingerprinting, such as [CanvasBlocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/).
      - Keep your browser updated to the latest version to benefit from the latest security and privacy enhancements.
      - Consider using browser containerization or multiple browser profiles to isolate different browsing activities.

      Browser fingerprinting in this implementation collects various browser-specific attributes using JavaScript APIs. This includes the user agent string, browser language settings, cookie enablement status, Do Not Track preference, vendor information, and installed plugins. It also detects whether you're using private browsing mode and identifies your specific browser name and version through user agent analysis.

      The combination of browser attributes creates a distinctive profile that can be used to identify and track your online activity. Even when using privacy features like VPNs or clearing cookies, these browser characteristics remain consistent and can be used to recognize your device across different websites and sessions.

    items:
      - Use privacy-focused browsers like [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/) that standardize browser fingerprints.
      - Enable privacy and tracking protection features in your browser settings.
      - Consider using browser extensions that modify or spoof browser information.
      - Regularly update your browser to benefit from the latest privacy enhancements.
      - Be cautious about installing browser plugins as they can make your fingerprint more unique.
